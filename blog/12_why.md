In other words, the autopilot source code cannot be expanded to include support for third-party hardware or software. This is contrary to every open source autopilot I have seen, and for probably good reason. If you buy a Pixhawk autopilot, you expect the option to modify the source code in case you want to use a LiDAR sensor that doesn't yet have a driver. It would probably be annoying if you had to attach the LiDAR to a separate microcontroller, and then connect that microcontroller to the autopitot via UART (serial). But this is exactly what we will be asking you to do.
