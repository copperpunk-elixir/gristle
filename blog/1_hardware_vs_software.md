# Hardware vs. Software
Software is great, but at some point it has to interact with hardware or it's useless. One of the pressing questions early on was how many of the hardware interfaces could be written in Elixir. For example, the first peripheral I wanted to test out was an IMU (inertial measurement unit), either the ICM-20948 or the BNO080. If I were working with Arduino, I would have libraries already available, ready to plug and play. 
> Should I connect the IMU to an Arduino board, and then interface with the Arduino board using a serial protocol of my choice? Or does the extra hardware outweigh the benefits of ready-to-use software?<br>

Since I was still very new to Elixir, I thought it would be interesting to attempt a driver for the IMU (I chose the BNO080), using [this](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14686) breakout board from Sparkfun. I opted to first take a shot at an I&#x00B2;C driver. After many frustrated hours of the board locking up on me, I discovered that the Raspberry Pi I&#x00B2;C bus is not capable of clock stretching, which apparently a thing, and something that the BNO080 requires. So...not a great start to the "write your own driver" experiment.
