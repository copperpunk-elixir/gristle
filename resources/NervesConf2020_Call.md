# Autonomous Vehicle Control - Strength in Numbers

# Elevator Pitch
"Many hands make light work." Can we achieve the robustness required for autonomous vehicle control without using expensive hardware and painstakingly-tested software? Can we mold moderately-reliable parts into an extremely reliable whole? Can we utilize the "Let it Crash" philosophy to ensure that our vehicle never does? I believe the answer is YES.

# Description

With Nerves and Elixir, it appears possible to create a decentralized cluster-based vehicle control system that can achieve sufficient levels of safety and robustness for autonomous operation, while maintaining short development cycles and an affordable price tag. I would like to present the work I have done towards this end, and demonstrate examples of this concept in action. Potential topics for discussion are:  
  * Why Nerves?
  * Node-level architecture
  * Cluster architecture
  * Ways to extend system capability
  * Challenges faced and lessons learned 


# Notes
I started learning Elixir in September 2019 for the purpose of designing a robust, affordable autopilot and immediately fell in love. Shortly thereafter I discovered Nerves, and thus I could see a path forward for getting my autopilot on a vehicle. Since then I have been putting in time during nights and weekends and have make decent progress towards a prototype. I am confident that I will be able to demonstrate the full concept of my work in October. As someone fairly new to Elixir, Nerves, and functional programming, I hope to serve as an example of how easy it is to get started with this platform.
